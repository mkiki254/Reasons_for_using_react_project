One last task:
Go to the google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400,600, and 700.
Put the links for to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index.html (Use the
<link/> elements instead of the @import or npm options for getting the fonts. You
may need to do some extra research to figure out how this works if you havent done
it before)

Also remember to download the react half logo. It is called react-icon-large
